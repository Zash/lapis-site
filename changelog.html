foreign key value by applying a function to each passed in object to load
* Relations can use *compured keys* where appropriate
* `lapis.validate.types` -- add `types.params_array`
* `lapis.validate.types` -- add `types.flatten_errors`
* `lapis.validate.types` -- `types.params_shape` can now accept numerical
names for fields for validating array like objects with a fixed number of
entries
* `lapis generate` -- Rockspec generator can now specify `--moonscript` and `--cqueues` to
automatically append dependencies
* `lapis migrate` -- Add the `--dry-run` flag to to run all pending migrations

## v1.14.0 - April 18 2023

### Additions

* Add `--rockspec` command to `lapis new`
* Add `lapis generate migration` command to either create blank migration file or append a new migration at the end of the existing migration file. See `lapis generate migration --help` for more information
  * Can append to Lua and MoonScript migrations files. It may not be able to edit all types of migration files, ensure that you return a simple table.
  * Support for appending either timestamp named migration or incrementing counter named migration
* Add `lapis generate rockspec` command to create a new rockspec for managing app dependencies. See `lapis generate rockspec --help` for more information
  * It will automatically detect the app name fro the current directory, if not specified with `--app-name`
  * It will automatically detect the git source URL from the current directory if a git repository has been created and has a remote
  * Additional initial dependencies can be included with flags like `--postgres`, `--sqlite`, `--moonscript`, etc.

### Fixes

* Fix code reloading for cqueues when changes to  `package.path`, `package.cpath`, `package.searchers`, and `package.loaders` is involved
  * These values will be reset to prevent infinitely growing module search path when reloading code
* Fix bug with `lapis simulate` command where header output wouldn't be normalized correctly
* Fix bug where `lapis.validate.types` `params_shape` was not correctly passing initial state object through the validation

### Changes

* Update custom sub-command runner to support running commands with `argparse` specification
  * Update built in support for [lapis annotate](https://github.com/leafo/lapis-annotate) and [lapis sytemd](https://github.com/leafo/lapis-systemd) to work with this new system. It is necessary to update both of those packages if you wish to use them with this version of Lapis
* Rewrite all template files that `lapis new` creates as generator modules. All of these files can be independently created using the `lapis generate` command if necessary, eg. `lapis generate app`
  * `lapis new` will now internally call `lapis generate` to create the necessary files
  * `lapis generate {NAME} --help` can now be used for every template generator to view configuration options
  * List of updated generators: (these can be called with `lapis generate {NAME}`)
    * `app` – For creating initial lapis application file in (`app.lua` or `app.moon`)
    * `config` – For creating `config.lua` or `config.moon`
    * `models` – For creating autoloader `modules.lua` or `modules.moon` module
    * `gitignore` – For creating initial `.gitignore` when using `lapis new --git` 
    * `tupfile` – For creating initial Tupfile and Tuprules.tup when using `lapis new --tup`
    * `nginx.config` – For creating initial `nginx.conf`
    * `nginx.mime_types` – For creating `mime.types` nginx configuration include
* The default generated config for cqueues on MoonScript no longer includes fields for `code_cache` and `num_workers`, and instead now matches the Lua version of the config.
* `lapis.db` `db.clause` supports a `prefix` option to optionally append something to the front of the encoded clause if it contains any fields.
* `lapis.db.model` Generic `preload` can take the a callback function with the name of a relation to execute a callback on the loaded objects. Eg. `preload(users, { profile = function(profiles) ... end })
* `Model:include_in` add `skip_included` option to do nothing on objects that already have the related field loaded
* `Model:include_in` add `loaded_results_callback` option to provide a function callback to be called with with the list of objects that were fetched from the query
* `Model:include_in` when loading objects by a composite key, duplicate composite values will be stripped to reduce the size of the query generated (Singular keys already functioned this way)
* `lapis.db.model.relations` `mark_loaded_relations` can now take a third argument of a value to set for the relation (defaults to `true`)
* `lapis.util` `singularize` function has been improved slightly with more cases (eg. vertex, child, index, status) and will work with all capital words. Note that this function will never be comprehensive, only suitable for calculating a quick default in scenarios where names aren't explicitly specified
* `lapis.validate.types` Add `multi_params` for joining two `params_shape` objects together

### Internal Changes

* Rewrite generic `preload`
* Add much more comprehensive test suite for generic `preload`


## v1.13.0 - February 15 2023

### Additions

* Add the `lapis simulate` command to simulate a request to the application
  without starting a server. This is useful for testing and debugging. See
  `lapis simulate --help` for details about usage.
* Add support for SQLite (See `lapis.db.sqlite`, `lapis.db.sqlite.model`,
  lapis.db.sqlite.schema`)
* Add `request:get_request()` method to get a reference to the request object.
  (Note this just returns `self`, but it is useful in cases where the request
  object is being proxied through the helper chain of a widget)

### Changes

* The default error page will now render a JSON response if the `accept`
  request header is set to `application/json`
* `content_for` now stores content blocks directly on the request object
  (prefixed with `_content_for`). This may solve a bug where widget helper
  chain could have cached an outdated copy of the `content_for` state.
* `content_for` will now throw an error if attempted to be used in a context
  without a request object
* Layout content rendering has been simplified to avoid additional closure and
  function scope created
* The resolved layout is now written to `request.options` (aka `self.options`)
  so that the view can know if a layout will be rendered within the current
  request. Note: actions that skip layout by default (eg. `json`, `redirect_to`)
  will write `false` to `options.layout`.
* Internal refactors to all of the database modules, removal of some
  undocumented functions (removed `set_backend`, `set_logger`, `get_logger`, `init_logger`)
* Updated generated SQL for MySQL in some places to output keywords in capitals
* `lapis.db.pagination` Paginators now have a simple fallback for clause
  generation when the database module lacks a clause parser. (Will work for
  simple queries without aggregates instead of throwing an error when calling
  `total_items` and `has_items`)
* `lapis.spec` Remove undocumented test helpers: `use_db_connection`, `assert_no_queries`.
* `lapis.spec` `use_test_env` and `use_test_server` no longer interact with
  database connection in `setup` and `teardown`.
* `lapis.spec.request` The mocked `ngx` object now covers more fields to make
  it suitable for more kinds of requests

## v1.12.0 - January 9 2023

### Additions

* Add the `lapis.validate.types` module with [tableshape](https://github.com/leafo/tableshape) compatible types for parameter validation: `params_shape`, `assert_error`, `cleaned_text`, `valid_text`, `trimmed_text`, `truncated_text`, `limited_text`, `empty`, `file_upload`, `db_id`, `db_enum`
* `lapis.validate` Add the `with_params` helper function for wrapping action function with parameter validation
* `lapis.util.utf8` Add `string_length` function for counting the number of characters in a string
* The `lapis new` command will always write a config.lua/config.moon file. The default configuration's nginx specific variables will be phased out a future update
* The `lapis generate` sub commands now can generate both Lua and MoonScript files. Project type detection has been added, in addition to flags to directly specify the file type

### Changes

* The `lapis` command line tool's argument parsing has been rewritten using [argparse](https://luarocks.org/modules/argparse/argparse). New help commands are available for every command, with full argument documentation.
* The `lapis generate` subcommands now use argparse and have full command line documentation available
* The `lapis new ` command will now fail if the requested server type is not available. The `--force` option can be used to bypass the error
* The default nginx.conf file now include an `init_by_lua` block as an example to suppress global variable warning
* Command line third-party sub commands now are executed using the `_` command. See `lapis help _`
* `lapis.application` `yield_error` now has a default error message if one isn't provided
* `lapis.validate` `assert_valid` can take a tableshape object as the validation object. Will return transformed value and state on success
* `lapis.db` `encode_clause` will now generate query with capital `NOT` when using false value

### Misc

* Internal reorganization for command line commands and path library
* Revised documentation for input validation

## v1.11.0 - December 16th 2022

### Additions

* `lapis.db` Add the `db.clause` constructor for safely building SQL fragments including clauses and conditionals
* All db related methods can now take `db.clause` objects when appropriate for configuring filtering (eg. `Model:find`, relation `where:` clause, etc.)
* `lapis.db` The `lapis.db.encode_clause` function can be used to convert a `db.clause` object a fragment of SQL code
* `lapis.application` Add `Application:extend()` method to create a sub-class of `Application` when MoonScript is not available
* `lapis.application` All route related methods are now consistently available for both application instances and classes. This includes `include`, `match`, `extend`, `find_action`, `before_filter`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`
* `lapis.session` The `get_session` function can now take a string object as first argument, as an alternative to the request object, to decode a session from a cookie's string value
* `lapis.html` Add `Widget:extend()` method for creating sublcass of the `Widget` class when MoonScript is not available
* `lapis.html` The `classnames` function will now recurisvely evaluate any tables in the argument
* `lapis.html` Add `is_mixins_class` function to determine if a class is a dynamically generated mixin class created by `Widget:include`
* `lapis.etlua` The `element` function has been added to the template scope to allow rendering HTML elements programmatically (similar to the HTML builder syntax)
* `lapis.etlua` `self` has been added to the template scope to allow accessing the instance of the `EtluaWidget`
* The `lapis migrate` command now supports a `--transaction` flag, can be set to `global` to apply a transaction across all migrations to be run, or `individual` to apply a transaction to each migration run.
* `lapis.flow` Add `Flow:extend()` method for sublcassing the `Flow` class

### Changes

* `lapis.db` Internally, queries now use `db.clause` to generate SQL conditional statements . This means that order of certain fields may now be different when using `where` clauses.
* `lapis.db` It is no longer possible to override fields configured by a relation when specifying a `where:` option. This also applies to paginators generated for relations
* `lapis.db.model` Relations can now be specified with a direct reference to a Model class, or a function that should resolve to a Model class (existing support for relation name has not changed)
* `lapis.application` Inheritance of routes is now more well defined, allowing for route names and paths to be overidden by subclasses or instances during the creation of the router. If you aren't using application inheritance then this will not affect you.
* `lapis.application` Lazy action loading is now supported for actions generated by `include` and actions built by the HTTP verb `match` helpers (`get`, `post`, etc.). Previously, if provided an action name (or `true`), it would load the action module immediately. Now all named actions are consistently loaded on first request regardless of where they are used
* `lapis.application` The `find_action` method now searches up inheritance hierarchy, and can be used on both app classes and instances
* `lapis.application` Trying to call `enable` or `match` directly on the `lapis.Application` class reference will now throw an error to help prevent accidentally mutating the global object
* `lapis.html` The `Widget:render()` method will now return nothing instead of `nil`
* `lapis.router` Router URL creation (aka `url_for`) has been rewritten to be substantially faster.  Previously routes were re-parsed on calls to `url_for` but will not generate from a cached intermediate form that will allow the URL to be generated with little overhead.
* `lapis.cqueues` Add error capturing around the app boot process to provide better error message when attempting to load a faulty app, and prevent infinite loop processing bug from `lua-http`
* The environment variable `LAPIS_FORCE_LOGGING` can not be set to `0` to force logging off
* The `application` field is no longer present on the `lapis.init` module.  This was never documented. Use `require("lapis.application")` instead.
* Many error messages have been rewritten to be prefixed with the module or method they originate from

### Internal Changes

These changes should have no effect on the end user implementing an app, but they are documented here in case you were depending on the undocumented structure of lapis

* `lapis.application` The internal structure used by the HTTP verb `match` helpers has been changed (`get`, `post`, etc.)
* `lapis.router` Parsed routes are now stored, and the arguments for `fill_path` have changed
* `lapis.application` The way routes are internally managed and iterated has been rewritten to provide unified interface based on metatable inheritance.  The `lapis.application.route_group` module has been added to work with this interface.

### Misc

* Substantial updates to documentation, including rewrites for clarify and documenting fields that were previously not documented.
* Changes to the homepage to prioritize Lua syntax over MoonScript to reduce confusion about what & who the framework is for

## v1.10.0 -- Oct 31 2022

### Additions

* `Model:include_in` supports a new  `{ load = false }` option to disable the conversion of query results to model instances
* You can now specify `{ order = false }` when creating a paginator from a model relation to strip the default order that may have been specified in the relation definition
* `lapis.util.utf8`: Add a UTF8 aware trim LPeg pattern, called `trim`) (Note: the utility function `trim` located `lapis.util` still only operates on ascii whitespace)

**Postgres**

* `model:update` method can take a `where` clause to apply a conditional update
* The return value of `model:update` is now well defined, and works similar to `model:delete`. Will return boolean `true`/`false` depending on if the update was able complete, and the resulting object from the update query. (**Warning:** Previously `model:update` would return the result object regardless of success as the first return value, but this functionality was undocumented.)
* `db.insert` can now take options as a table, and supports receiving `returning` columns as a option
* Add the `{ on_conflict = "do_nothing" }` option to `db.insert` to not throw an error if insertion is canceled due to a unique key constraint conflict (using the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` query syntax introduced in Postgres 9.5)

**MySQL**

* `model:update` will return `true` if the number of affected rows is greater than 0, followed by the result object

## Changes
* `lapis.html`: All element helper methods (eg. `div`, `b`, `span`, etc.) now return `nil` instead of the previously undocumented behavior of returning the buffer object. This is to prevent accidentally leaking data when writing malformed syntax such as `div div!` (instead of the correct (`div -> div!`)
* `lapis.util.utf8`: whitespace pattern is aware of invalid use of direction markers
* `lapis.db.postgres.model`: On model creation, if a `returning *` clause is provided then unnecessary extra returning fields are not included in the query
* `lapis.db.postgres`: Nginx environment detection is more accurate to allow pgmoon connections to be created without error in more stages of the Nginx worker/request lifecycle
* `lapis.db.postgres`: OpenResty specific performance metrics about socket reuse are only written when an nginx socket is in use 
* `lapis.db.postgres`: Add connection specific performance metric for when any socket type other than nginx is used

### Bugs
* `lapis.validate`: Fixed bug where the input options table passed into validate would get mutated, removing the `optional` field


### Misc
* Assorted updates to docs
* Expanded test suite, refactors to tests
* Documentation typo fixes by  @tommy-mor in [#734](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/734) [#746](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/746)

## v1.9.0 -- March 29 2021

### Changes

* `Widget\include` is now implemented completely different: A dynamic mixins class is generated and inserted into the class hierarchy of the widget when `include` is first called. All fields and methods from any included classes are copied into this mixin class.
  * It's now possible to override a method that is provided by an included class. (The current class has higher precedence than the *mixins* class)
  * `super` can be used to call the method provided by the included by the class when overriding
  * Some undocumented functionality regarding method merging was removed
  * Only one mixin class will be inserted, and all included classes will copy their fields into that class. The most recently included classes will override anything that has the same time. (Note: there is no hierarchy for multiple includes, so you can't use `super` to call through multiple included classes)
  * Methods from the class hierarchy of the included class are also copied into the mixin class.  (Note: methods are copied, and the hierarchy is flattened, meaning methods that depend on super may not work as intended)
  * Note: The "dynamic mixin class" approach is also used for models when relation methods are generated
* `lapis.spec.request.stub_request` no longer creates an anonymous app subclass, instead it will override the dispatch method on an instance of the class before stubbing the request
* `lapis.spec.request.mock_action` will no longer push the `test` environment on every call, but instead will use the current environment. (Note: v1.8.2 added autodetection of busted to ensure specs are always running the test environment, so it's not necessary to manually set the environment)


### Additions

* Add support for `on_invalid_method` option to `respond_to`
* `fetch` relation can be set to `true` to autogenerate a `get_` method based
on the provided `preload` function
* Added support for *optional* reloations with `db.preload`. Relation names prefixed with `?` will be ignored if the object being preloaded does not contain a relation with that name.
  * For example, trying to preload the relation `hello` when the model does not have `hello` will result in an error, but preloading `?hello` will do nothing.
  * Optional `?` relations can have nested preloads, if the relation is not found then none of the nested preloads are loaded. This works best when combined with polymorphic relations where the objects may not all share the same relation interface.

### Fixes

* Lazy loaded actions work correctly when merged from sub applications
* Before filters work correctly with lazy loaded actions
* Lazy loaded actions work with Lua method responders

### Misc

* Default error page has encoding set to UTF-8
* Simplify implmentation of `preload_relations`, deprecate it
* Optimize concatenations `db.encode_values`
* Improve error messages for some functions
*  `db.encode_assigns`, `db.encode_clause`, `db.encode_values` throws error on empty table instead of generating invalid SQL from empty table
* `sorted_pairs` spec helper
* Additional specs (`respond_to`, widget including, lazy loaded actions)

## v1.8.3 -- February 9 2021

### Additions 

* Support lazy loading route actions from route name to module name [#710](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/710)
* Add UTF8 helper module, `lapis.utf8`, for identifying single UTF8 chars and whitespace (lpeg patterns that can be used for trimming and sanitization)
* Add `cascade` option to postgres drop index schema function

### Changes

* Remove unused `mimetypes` dependency
* If `yield_error` or `assert_error` are not captured by a outer coroutine then a hard error will happen
* `Request\add_params` does not need a name
* When searching for OpenResty installation, also accept a binary named `openresty` (for openresty install on mac with brew)
* pgmoon connection error messages are prefixed with "postgres" to make them easier to identify
* remove excess `;` characters in generated SQL for some postgres schema functions
* Postgres create index schema function `if_not_exists` option will now use the sql clause `if not exists` instead of running a query to see if the entity exists

### Misc

* Update test suite to GitHub actions, remove TravisCI. Test suite works across all versions of Lua
* Update docker test suite to latest postgres/mysql 


## v1.8.2 -- September 21 2020

### Additions

* `db.delete` can take additional arguments for `RETURNING`, `Model\delete`
method also supports additional arguments to control returning clause
* `get_X_paginated` model relation method now supports passing `where` and
`order` options to the paginator constructor

### Fixes

* Using `order` and `group` at the same time with `Model\include_in` will no
longer generate an invalid query
* When running `lapis` command, the environment is immediately loaded when
checking what commands are available for the server, fixes
[#665](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/665)
* `lapis.nginx.cache` can correctly serialize array and boolean types that can
result from parameter parsing, fixes
[683](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/68)
* The substring `-` is no longer matched by accident for route pattern filters [#696](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/696)

### Changes

* When running in `busted`, the `test` environment is set as the default
environment any tests are run. It is not longer necessary to have a `setup` or
`use_test_env` call to configure the environment
* Default buffer size and timout for parsing multipart form data has been
increased to allow for slower connections (4k bytes per 5 seconds)
* All logging goes stdout when not running in Nginx
* Compatibility patches for Lua 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
* Improved error message for some `lapis` commands when using an incomplete
configuration
* Improved error message when file can not be written when generating app
files
* (Internal) `default_environment` function moved to `lapis.environment`
module, added `set_default_environment` function
* Better error message when trying to use `belongs_to` with composite key
(`has_one` should be used instead)
* Better error when trying to use default composite primary key with a
`has_one` relation

### Misc

* Test suites run across on all versions of Lua on GitHub actions
* Added docs for how [request parameters are parsed and
merged]($root/reference/actions.html#request-parameters)
* Added docs for [how the default environment
works]($root/reference/configuration.html#default-environment)
* Fixed bug in docs generator where code snippets were not appearing
* The `--trace` option for the `lapis` command is enabled by default when running in test
* Fix minor typos in docs

## v1.8.1 -- April 27 2020

  * An `ordered` option can be passed to `Model\paginated` an `get_X_paginated`
  to create an `OrderedPaginator` instead of a `OffsetPaginator`
  * Add `skip_render` action render option to prevent Lapis from writing
  anything (Suitable for manually writing to output buffer with something like
  `ngx.print`)
  * `fetch` relations can now specify if they return a collection of items with
  `many` so nested preloading can traverse the loaded objects
  * add `serve` alias for the `lapis server` command line command
  * add `app_only` code cache option for cqueues to attempt to load app on every
  dispatch
  * A `resty_mysql` object can be included in the MySQL configuration object to

  captured and execution attempted to continue
  * initial project templates use `content_by_lua_block` (Contributed by
  ryanford [674](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/674))
  * `each_page` method on paginators no longer allocates a coroutine, a plain
  function iterator is used

  * attempting to use an invalid order with `OrderedPaginator` will throw an
  error
  * `measure_performance` now works even when outside of nginx when reporting
  query time
  * (`lapis.html`) `classnames` ignores empty strings and will return first
	argument directly if passed a string
  * (`lapis.logging`) `query` log function can now take a prefix and duration
  * Removed undocumented `locals` action render option

### Fixes

  * Fix bug where internal shell_escape function would strip `'` characters

* Mocked requests have `ngx.md5` implemented with `luacrypto`
* Query logs use luasocket to measure time elapsed for a more accurate measurement
* URL parsing uses `find` and `sub` instead of `match` to parse very long paths faster ([#498](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/498))

** Minor changes **

* Lua and MoonScript are added as mime types in default `mime.types` file ([#513](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/513))
* Various improvements to the documentation

** Fixes **

* Encoding a query string with a parameter with a boolean value will no longer throw an error
* Fix issue where `*.lua` would be included in `.gitignore` for Lua projects ([#501](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/501))

** Note on `cqueues`/`lua-http` **

With this release we're adding a new server backend for Lapis. Although the
backend is functional, there are some things that aren't available yet.
Database connections are shared across all requests so you have to be careful
about leaving transactions or state open. Additionally, there's no way to spawn
multiple workers. For production environments we still recommend OpenResty.

## v1.5.1 -- July 21st 2016

** Security Fixes **

* The `trim` implementation was vulnerable to high CPU usage with a specially crafted string due to how the pattern was written. (More information: [4a58f5c1](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/commit/4a58f5c12582796b3c7e0ad784630fc6be56b92d))

** Changes ** 

* Flows now use `_` as the backing variable, so it's clear they can be used on any type of object. (Previously `_req`)
* Interval fields cleaned up and renamed on `Request` to make way for different server backends
* Nginx specific modules moved to make way for different server backends (daurnimator)
