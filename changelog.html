## v1.8.0 -- April 24 2018

#### Deprecations

  * The `flip` and `local_key` used with `include_in` or any relations are now
  deprecated. Replacement syntax available in [documentation for
  `Model\include_in`]($root/reference/models.html#class-methods/include_in)

#### Additions

  * Add support for a column mapping table when specifying the key for
  `include_in` and any relations. See more documentation for
  [`Model\include_in`]($root/reference/models.html#class-methods/include_in)
  * Add support for composite foreign keys with `include_in` and relations
  * `each_item` method for Paginators that will return a Lua iterator for going
  over every row but queries in batches set by `per_page`
  * An `ordered` option can be passed to `Model\paginated` an `get_X_paginated`
  to create an `OrderedPaginator` instead of a `OffsetPaginator`
  * Add `skip_render` action render option to prevent Lapis from writing
  anything (Suitable for manually writing to output buffer with something like
  `ngx.print`)
  * `fetch` relations can now specify if they return a collection of items with
  `many` so nested preloading can traverse the loaded objects
  * add `serve` alias for the `lapis server` command line command
  * add `app_only` code cache option for cqueues to attempt to load app on every
  dispatch
  * A `resty_mysql` object can be included in the MySQL configuration object to
  provide additional parameters when initializng a `resty.mysql` connection
  * Pgmoon connections will now read the `timeout` field from the PostgreSQL
  config object (Contributed by turbo [679](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/679))
  * Add `set_logger` and `get_logger` functions to the `lapis.db.mysql` and
  `lapis.db.postgres` module
  * (`lapis.db.postgres`) `escape_identifier` function will now flatten `db.list`
  objects into raw SQL
  * (`lapis.db.postgres.schema`) `create_index` support a `concurrently` option to
  create index concurrently (Contributed by Michael Ball [659](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/659))
  * add `test` validation for manually specifying a function to test input

#### Changes

  * `assert_error` will now fail with `error` if the error it yielded was not
  captured and execution attempted to continue
  * initial project templates use `content_by_lua_block` (Contributed by
  ryanford [674](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pull/674))
  * `each_page` method on paginators no longer allocates a coroutine, a plain
  function iterator is used
  * attempting to preload an object that isn't a class will throw an error
  * attempting to use an invalid order with `OrderedPaginator` will throw an
  error
  * `measure_performance` now works even when outside of nginx when reporting
  query time
  * (`lapis.html`) `classnames` ignores empty strings and will return first
	argument directly if passed a string
  * (`lapis.logging`) `query` log function can now take a prefix and duration
  * Removed undocumented `locals` action render option

#### Fixes

  * Fix bug where internal shell_escape function would strip `'` characters
  * Returning `{ json = false }` in action render will actually render false as
  json instead of skipping json render

#### Documentation

  * Started rewriting how options tables are described in the documentation.
  Uses a grid layout with collapsing examples.
  * Many parts of Models documentation have been rewritten for clarity
  * Remove outdated references to fields that are deprecated/removed (eg.

* Terminal output buffering is disabled for cqeueus/lua-http so service files can read logs from stdout/stderr

## v1.6.0 -- July 20th 2017

** Additions **

* Add a new general purpose `preload` function that can preload many relations
at once for many kinds of model instances, including recursively preloading relations

* Mocked requests have `ngx.md5` implemented with `luacrypto`
* Query logs use luasocket to measure time elapsed for a more accurate measurement
* URL parsing uses `find` and `sub` instead of `match` to parse very long paths faster ([#498](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/498))
* `db.NULL` values are always stripped when inserting a new row from a model's `create` method
* Test server can be run even if there isn't a database configured

* Various improvements to the documentation

** Fixes **

* Encoding a query string with a parameter with a boolean value will no longer throw an error
* Fix issue where `*.lua` would be included in `.gitignore` for Lua projects ([#501](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues/501))

** Note on `cqueues`/`lua-http` **

With this release we're adding a new server backend for Lapis. Although the
backend is functional, there are some things that aren't available yet.
Database connections are shared across all requests so you have to be careful
about leaving transactions or state open. Additionally, there's no way to spawn
multiple workers. For production environments we still recommend OpenResty.

## v1.5.1 -- July 21st 2016

** Security Fixes **

* The `trim` implementation was vulnerable to high CPU usage with a specially crafted string due to how the pattern was written. (More information: [4a58f5c1](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/commit/4a58f5c12582796b3c7e0ad784630fc6be56b92d))

** Additions **

* `has_one` relations can specify a `local_key` (similar to the parameter passed to `include_in`)
* `has_many` relations can specify a `local_key`
* Add a generate template for flows: `lapis generate flow my_flow`

** Changes ** 

* Flows now use `_` as the backing variable, so it's clear they can be used on any type of object. (Previously `_req`)
* Interval fields cleaned up and renamed on `Request` to make way for different server backends
* Nginx specific modules moved to make way for different server backends (daurnimator)
* Add `/opt/openresty/nginx/sbin/` to the OpenResty search path for `lapis server` (Cristian Haunsen)

** Fixes **

* `has_one` work correctly by default if primary key is not `id`
* Many documentation fixes, thanks to [all the contributors](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
* Host and port correct passed to console MySQL connection (Douglas Roeder)

* Flows instances inherit the `__call` metamethod
* Passing `nil` as an argument to truncate tables will error
* Request support methods no longer take up names on the request object
* The cookie and session loading code is now overridable

** Fixes **

* Fix issue where `url_for` was including character class of named parameter in result
* Fix issue with `--trace` flag interrupting arguments of command line commands

## v1.4.2 -- January 22nd 2016

** Additions **
