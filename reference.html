<h1>Lapis $current_version Reference Manual</h1>

$markdown{[[
Welcome to the [Lapis]($root) reference manual. You can find a list of all the
guides to the left. Because Lapis is a hybrid framework for both Lua and
MoonScript you can toggle language of the examples in the documentation from
the sidebar. Some guides only apply to a certain language.

If you're not sure what Lapis is you can find a general overview on the
homepage: <http://leafo.net/lapis>.

Lapis is open source, you can find the souce code here:
<http://github.com/leafo/lapis>.

If you are having any problems with Lapis open an issue on the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/leafo/lapis/issues?state=open).
